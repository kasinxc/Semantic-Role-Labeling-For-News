15172	https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/autoinsurance/12-things-your-auto-insurance-agent-knows-that-you-dont/ar-BB7QdgM~5390	12 things your auto insurance agent knows that you don't car insurance companies employ armies of underwriters and actuaries who crunch insurance numbers all day but it the auto insurance agents who really know the score agents know a company guidelines and products inside and out as they stand on the front lines and field questions from customers a lot of consumers think they have an idea of how car insurance works and think they are informed but they aren't says amanda shore operations analyst for insurance com call center they understand a new hyundai is cheaper to insure than a new mercedes and that their driving record is pulled but many aren't aware that where they live is such a big deal and that many other reports and rating factors are looked at when consumers call for a car insurance quote shore estimates that agents spend about 20 percent of a 10-minute call explaining coverages and making recommendations even more if the person is a first-time buyer ultimately you can make a more informed decision on your own if you know what going on behind the scenes here are some of the things agents know that customers typically don't 1 they know which reports are pulled about you when you request a car insurance quote insurance companies don't operate on the honor system when you tell them how long your commute is or whether you've gotten any speeding tickets but your agent knows that all the information you provide is double-checked you probably suspect that insurers look at reports showing your claims history motor vehicle record and credit history but an agent also knows if the carrier is pulling reports on your mileage vehicle registration undisclosed drivers who live with you whether you're a homeowner and your current carrier and agents know whether the reports are used in the calculation of your insurance score which is similar to a credit score you also don't have access to your fico insurance score by the way 2 they know your vehicle iso rating iso vehicle series rating program assigns one of 75 symbols to vehicles based on items such as make model and safety ratings and then takes into account real-life loss records for the vehicle the vehicle rating helps insurance companies determine the risk of insuring your particular vehicle the higher the rating the higher the risk for the insurance company which translates into higher premiums for you there are ratings for the physical damage liability and medical portions of a car insurance policy you've probably never seen your car iso rating but your agent can easily see where your vehicle falls on the list not all insurers use iso symbols to set rates the new york department of financial services published a partial list of iso symbols 3 they know if a ticket will jack up your car insurance rates ah it the age-old question will that speeding ticket make my rates go up not all traffic tickets are equal an agent knows which types of tickets won't affect your rates typically parking equipment and other non-moving offenses and which ones will and by how much how agents are privy to your insurance company surcharge schedule which outlines the offenses that trigger insurance points and of what value the points are added up to determine how much your rates will go up you can ask your car insurance company for a copy of its surcharge schedule but may still need an agent to decipher it for you here are examples of surcharge schedules and rate increases 4 they know when your tickets will drop off your driving record you may have forgotten when your last traffic ticket landed on your driving record but your agent knows since your car insurance company pulled your driving record your agent can see the violation date and should also know when the infraction will drop off your record and can no longer impact your premiums if your state doesn't remove traffic violations from your driving record then ask your agent when your car insurance provider stops surcharging you on the offense typically it can be three five or seven years your agent also knows this the surcharge won't drop off until the next renewal term after the required time period has passed since changes like this aren't made mid-term 5 they know whether your rates will go up if you make a claim you rear-ended someone on the way to work and now you're wondering how long this will haunt you should you try to pay off the other driver or let him make a claim against you car insurance companies have strict rules about when surcharges are applied after an accident or claim and they vary by insurer your agent will know the details about which claims raise rates even if you have a copy of your auto insurer surcharge schedule you will probably still need your agent help to understand the complex formula used to determine a surcharge the process is usually even more complicated if it is your second or subsequent accident or violation in recent years the type of claim also plays a role for instance a bodily injury claim may hike rates more than a property damage claim all in all you're unlikely to know a claim impact until you make it 6 they know whether your crashed vehicle will be considered a total loss if your car frame is bent or the mechanic tells you it can't be fixed you can bet your car is going to be deemed a total loss by your car insurance company but sometimes what appears to be only minor damage can get your car totaled the criteria for determining whether a vehicle is a total loss varies from one car insurance company to the next and is also guided by state law while your car insurance agent isn't a claims expert or adjuster he is aware that your car insurance company will compare the cost of repair to your vehicle actual cash value and then look at the total loss threshold to see if the car is totaled or not if the repair costs are over a certain internally set or state-set threshold your car will be totaled 7 they know if you're at risk for non-renewal you might think your third accident in as many years isn't a big deal but your agent knows the real score your agent is aware of the company guidelines for non-renewing a policyholder and at a glance can see if anything in your file will result in a non-renewal notice at the end of your policy period the guidelines vary by state law and by company a variety of issues may prompt an insurer to wave goodbye to you agent	12 things your auto insurance
